At the agency, I created different tracking setups for different clients so that the client and our marketing staff could make decisions based on the data.\nThis led me to further my education in programming, which solidified my passion. In my last projects at BCM Solutions GmbH it became clear that programming is what I want to do. I have turned my hobby into my profession. Thanks to my marketing training, you gain an employee who thinks outside the box, goes the extra mile, and can implement designs in a very user-oriented way.",
